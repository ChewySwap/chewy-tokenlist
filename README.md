# ChewySwap Exchange Tokenlist

![1.00](blob:https://milkdown.dev/7a00d88e-8877-4e2c-81cd-e1887cd541ae)

ChewySwap is the first multichain Decentralized Exchange with a focus on dog-based memecoin blockchains such as Shiba Inu's Shibarium and the unofficial EVM compatible Dogecoin layer 2 called Dogechain. This repository contains the official default token list

## More Information

ChewySwap exchange was created to help bring together the two amazing communities of Shiba Inu and Doge, once thought to be rivals we believe that all shibas can play together without getting too ruff! With a focus on building tools and innovative use cases, easing the friction of onboarding and helping to bring mass adoption, ChewySwap DAO is on a mission to change the "degenerate gambler" stigma that memecoins usually have.

### Community Comes First

## Shibarium Token Creation

Either deploy a token using our partner pump fun-like platform [Bondle](https://bondle.xyz/), our free [no-code simple token deployer](https://token.chewy.build/), [Gempad Token Deployer](https://legacy.gempad.app/create-token), or deploy a custom token contract using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/). For tax/reflection tokens our Shibarium router address is:

## Dogechain Token Creation

Either use our simple token [no-code token deployer](https://token.chewy.build/) or deploy a custom token contract using [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/). For tax/reflection tokens our Shibarium router address is:

## How to Submit your Token

Create a commit in ./tokens/addresses creating a folder with your token's Shibarium contract address, in it containing your token's **transparent** background **logo.png** no larger than **250x250**! It's required that your token has enough liquidity on ChewySwap to be properly traded and that the project's main liquidity is **locked** for a reasonable period of time. \* Minimum starting liquidity varies by project's current state and quality. You may also submit your token logo and information to an admin in our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/chewyswapcommunity) but submitting to GitHub is preferred to keep everything in one place.

New tokens will be added on a weekly basis as long as the project has a **safe** contract with its code **verified** on [Shibariumscan](https://www.shibariumscan.io/). For faster consideration leave a link to your project's Telegram group or your admin's Telegram handle in the commit description. To expedite the process you may join our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/ChewySwapCommunity) and let us know you made a commit with your logo.
